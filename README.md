## What is this Repository?

This Project uses Machine-Learning to detect a possible diagnosis of [Colon Ischemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_ischemia) from a Hospital's Patient Record. 
To achieve this, we apply multiple Feature-Selection Strategies to (dis-)select Features in the Dataset which may not be relevant to the Problem. 
This repository features multiple Classification-Algorithms, such as XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest and Neural Networks to classify the clinical records.
